# Machine_Learning_Application_using_Balls_dataset

### Description :
* Below application uses Decision Tree algorithm to classify the type of ball.
* In this application training set contains two types of balls.
* Features of our training set is weight and type of surface of ball.
* We are using two labels as Tennis and Cricket.
* We train our data set using Decision tree algorithm.

### Consider below characteristics of Machine Learning Application :
* Classifier : Decision Tree
* DataSet : Balls Dataset
* Features : Weight & Surface type
* Labels : Tennis and Cricket
* Training Dataset : 15 Entries
* Testing Dataset : 1 Entry

### Training set referred by above application

Note: In Source code Rough is considered as 1 and Smooth is considered as 0 as well as Tennis is considered as 1 and Cricket is considered as 2

### This Appication is example of Supervised machine learning:
Supervised machine learning : Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to
new data using labeled examples to predict future events.
Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces
an inferred function to make predictions about the output values.
The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training.
The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and
find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.

### Algorithm used :- Decision tree algorithm

### Steps used to design this application :
Step1: Get the data for the machine learning application. </br>
Step2: Clean, prepare and manipulate that data. </br>
Step3. Decide the machine learning algorithm and train the dataset. </br>
Step4. Test the algorithm with some test dataset. </br>
Step5. Depending on the test result improve the algorithm.  </br>
